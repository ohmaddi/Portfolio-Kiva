##Importing data

```{r}

# Cam: That's a really impressive amount of data! I did have a bit of a problem importing without `here()`, but other than that it worked fine.
loans1 <- import(here("data", "kiva_loans1.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
loans2 <- import(here("data", "kiva_loans2.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
loans <- bind_rows(loans1, loans2)
theme_id <- import(here("data", "loan_theme_ids.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
isoAlpha <- import(here("data", "isoAlphacodes.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
region <- import(here("data", "kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
theme_region <- import(here("data", "loan_themes_by_region.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
gini <- import(here("data", "GINI.csv"), setclass = "tbl_df")
loans_region <- region %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  filter(country != "") %>%
  right_join(loans, by = "country")
# Cam: Nice use of a left_join. I did note that it actually looked like a many-to-many join. To fix this, I grabbed just the first occurance of each country in region and then joined them. 

colnames(gini) = gini[1, ]
gini = gini[-1,]

colnames(gini)[colnames(gini) == "Country Code"] <- "Alpha-3 code"
gini_iso2 <- left_join(gini, isoAlpha, by = "Alpha-3 code") 

colnames(gini_iso2)[colnames(gini_iso2) == "Alpha-2 code"] <- "country_code"
colnames(gini_iso2)[colnames(gini_iso2) == "2014"] <- "gini"
```

##Joining GINI data with Kiva loans data

```{r fig.height=8}
loans1 <- left_join(loans, theme_id)

loans_gini <- left_join(loans1, gini_iso2, by = "country_code")
loans_gini1 <- na.omit(loans_gini)

fund_gini <- aggregate(funded_amount ~ country_code, data = loans_gini1, FUN = sum)
colnames(fund_gini)[colnames(fund_gini) == "funded_amount"] <- "total_funds"
totfund_gini <- left_join(fund_gini, loans_gini1, by = "country_code")



```


##Top 10 countries using Kiva loans

```{r}

Top_10 <- loans %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(country = reorder(country,Count)) %>%

#What is the gender distribution among this countries. We will now group by country and gender but keep only the top 10 countries by using a left join to our Top_10 dataset 
Top_10_g <- loans %>%
  group_by(country, borrower_genders) %>%
  summarise(Count_g = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count_g)) %>%

  mutate(g1 = str_to_title(g1))
  
#map(a, ~sum(is.na(.))) This is just to check if I covered all genders listed in the borrowers gender column. I stopped at g45 becasue as I added g46 all the the observations were missing which means I covered all of them at g45

p1 <- ggplot(Top_10_full_g, aes(x = fct_reorder(country, Count),y = `sum(Count_g)`, fill = g1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', show.legend = TRUE) + # Cam: Could just be my screen, but it looked like the geom_texts were not correctly placed so I dropped them and added the legend back. I moved the legend so it would be inset into the plot. I also mutated the column to get the legend levels in title case. 
  labs(title = "Top 10 countries borrowing from Kiva by gender",
       subtitle = "Gender of the 1st member of the team",
       x = "", y = "") +

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(.8,.3))

```

##Mapping the number of loans brorowed from Kiva

```{r}
leaflet(theme_region) %>% addTiles() %>% # Cam: This is really cool! I've never come accross leaflet and it seems very user friendly. 
  addCircles(lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, radius = ~(number),
             color = ~c("blue")) 
```

##World regions 

```{r}
p3 <- loans_region %>%
  group_by(world_region) %>%
  summarise(Count = n() / 1000) %>% # Cam: Since the highest grouping seems to be 200,000, I'm not sure having the x-axis in millions makes sense. (I realize this is probably a result of changing the mant-to-many join above)
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(world_region = reorder(world_region,Count)) %>%
  na.omit() %>% #Cam: Nice job passing the data straight through to ggplot!
  ggplot(aes(world_region, Count)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity', colour = "white", fill = "grey60") +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "", 
         y = "Number of loans in thousands",
         title = "Number of loans borrowed from Kiva by \n world region") +
    theme_minimal()

```

## Boxplot distribution of funded amount (logged)

```{r}
top_l <- loans_gini1 %>% select(`Loan Theme Type`, funded_amount) %>% top_n(50,wt=funded_amount) 

p4 <- ggplot(top_l, aes(x=fct_reorder(`Loan Theme Type`,funded_amount), y= funded_amount, col=`Loan Theme Type`)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  scale_y_log10()+ # Cam: Nice use of a logarithmic scale! 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x="", y="", 
       title="Boxplot distribution of funded amount",
       subtitle="Grouped by Loan Theme Type (top 50)")
```

```{r}
p2 <- loans %>% select(sector,loan_amount) %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(sum_ta = sum(loan_amount)) %>%
  mutate(perct = sum_ta/sum(loans$loan_amount)*100)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(sector, perct),y = (perct / 100)))+ # Cam: Good job reordering by perct!
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill = "steelblue")+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_label(aes(label = round((perct),2)), size = 3, y= 0.025, col = "black") + # Cam: I REALLY like these labels. 
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),
        axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1), # Cam: Turning the numbers doesn't seem necessary to me. Changing the y-axis to a percentage may also help reduce cognitive load. 
        axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x="Sectors",
       y="Percentage",
       title= "Loans disribution by sector") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```


#Visualization 1
## Kiva at a glance

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
ggarrange(p4, p3, p1, p2 ,
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2) # Cam: I believe Daniel might have mentioned ggarrange in the past, but I totally forgot about it. This is really cool. Being able to set ncol and nrow as easy as with setting up a matrix is really nifty. 
```


##The use of the funded amount 

```{r }
kiva_words <- loans %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, use, token = "words")

kiva_words <- kiva_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% # Cam: Awesome use of an antijoin!
  filter(word != "buy",
         word != "sell",
         word != "purchase",
         word != "pay",
         word != "business") # Cam: Since I would assume that almost all Kiva loans include the word buy, sell, purchase, pay, busines, etcetera, I would likely treat these as stop word. I think is very illuminating to see water is one of the most used words in Kiva loans.

kv_counts <- kiva_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

kv_filter <- kv_counts %>%
  filter(n > 16000)

kv_filter_angle <- kv_filter %>%
  mutate(angle = 90 * sample(c(0, 1), n(), 
                             replace = TRUE, 
                             prob = c(50, 50)))
set.seed(12)

p5 <- ggplot(kv_filter_angle, aes(label = word, size = n, color = n, angle = angle)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(rm_outside = TRUE) + # Cam: Looks really cool. Dropping the unfitted words probably makes sense in this case. 
  scale_size_area(max_size = 25) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") # Cam: I did not know that this existed! Being able to change disscrete palettes to continuous palettes is a game changer!

```


###I was hoping for the word invest to be on the top but it does not even belong to the list. 

##How people tweet about the project

```{r }
kiva_tag <- loans %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, tags, token = "words")

kiva_tag <- kiva_tag %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  filter(word != "user_favorite")

kvtag_counts <- kiva_tag %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

kvtag_filter <- kvtag_counts %>%
  filter(n > 100)

kvtag_filter_angle <- kvtag_filter %>%
  mutate(angle = 90 * sample(c(0, 1), n(), 
                             replace = TRUE, 
                             prob = c(50, 50)))
set.seed(12)

p6 <- ggplot(kvtag_filter_angle, aes(label = word, size = n, color = n, angle = angle)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(rm_outside = TRUE) +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 25) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") # Cam: I think this palette does a good job redundant coding the use of these words on twitter. 

```

#Visualization 2
```{r fig.width=9}
ggarrange(p5, p6 , 
          ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

This is to compare the way people who benifit from the loan communicate about the use of the loan versus how the people tweet about the use of the loans on Twitter. Daniel has recommemnded using a bar chart to show the top words used in the two different cases. While I agree that a bar chart would give us more information especially in terms of frequence of the use of the words, I think that the worldcloud communicate the message better to the general public comparing the words of the same color across the two clouds. 

#Visualization 3
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
loans_gini11 <- left_join(loans_gini1, loans_region, by = "id") # Cam: I'm thoroughly impressed with the number of left_joins you used!

# Cam: I'm not sure if me fixing the many-to-many join threw what I'm seeing off, but, based off what I am seeing, I would suggest dropping the facet wrap. Looking at inter-regionally, there does not seem to be a clear relationship between the two variables of interest. I also wonder, if you collapsed within country, whether the number of points would be more manageable.
ggplot(loans_gini11, aes(funded_amount.x, gini)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + # Cam: Again, nice use of a logarithmic scale!
  theme_minimal() + # Cam: It goes without saying, but the minimal theme is very slick!
  labs(x = "Funded Amount",
       y = "GINI",
       title = "") # Cam: Certainly an effective way and novel (to me) solution for dropping the title!


# Great work, Ouafaa!
```

I thinks this visualization still needs many suggestion to communicate the message better. I would really appreciate any feedback on this one. 

Thank you!!
